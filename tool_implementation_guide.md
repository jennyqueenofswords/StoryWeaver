     When to use: Starting exploration, unclear patterns
     
   □ Evolution Tracking Tool
     Best for: Active pattern transformation
     When to use: Clear pattern, ready for change
     
   □ Reality Bridge Builder
     Best for: Implementation support
     When to use: Ready for practical action

3. Integration Support
   □ Chapter Mapping Template
     Best for: Story development, meaning making
     When to use: Need narrative coherence
     
   □ Breakthrough Capture Tool
     Best for: Significant insights, shifts
     When to use: Major realizations, transformations
     
   □ Implementation Checklist
     Best for: Practical integration
     When to use: Ready for consistent practice
```
